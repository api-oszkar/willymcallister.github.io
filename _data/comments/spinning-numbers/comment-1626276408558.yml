  Depending on the layout of the house and the wishes of the customer to the
  design can be used marching, slanting, screw, combined and other types of
  glass stairs. Floating is a relatively simple type of stairs straight or
  curved designs, the essential element of which is the presence of the inclined
  series of steps and connecting them stairs (respectively rectangular or
  semicircular shape). The most common type of stairway has a slope of 30-45Â°.
  In such a ladder, the biomechanics of a person who moves up or down it is
  taken into account as much as possible. The advantage of the design of the
  flight stairs-the maximum strength with a minimum number of connections. For
  attaching stairs to the Bolza is used the same type of hinged plates boltov
  that is a metal fastener, which is used for sequential mounting steps. Stairs
  can be straight or winder. This type of ladder design allows you to make the
  mount almost invisible in connection with what has gained great popularity
  among designers. But, despite the "visual lightness", these stairs are able to
  withstand heavy loads, in particular, in cases where the design of the stairs
  is enhanced by a combination with a braid, bowstring or wall mount. In terms
  of design and construction, the combined staircases are characterized by a
  free spatial configuration, in which the elements of the staircases are
  combined with various spiral (screw) structures. Most modular and small stairs
  are also combined. Combined glass stairs-a vivid example of architectural
  construction in the style of "eclecticism" - the direction in which an
  arbitrary combination of styles, designs and materials is used. They are
  original engineering and artistic solutions. To perform such complex work
  requires the joint work of the architect and designer and, of course, a high
  level of professionalism of the installation team <a
